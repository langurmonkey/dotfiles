# Background story

See my [dotfiles](https://codeberg.org/langurmonkey/dotfiles) in their current state.

**TLDR**; I like simple and streamlined solutions. Traditional floating window managers and desktop environments are neither simple enough nor streamlined at core. Tiled window managers are, and I like `i3wm` for reasons. Pull the thread.

It looks like my configuration has converged to what is in this repo. Of course, the dotfiles endeavour is an ongoing enterprise, so I am sure it will keep evolving over time. I am a long-time Linux user. During all my years using Linux, I distro-hopped several times. I started with Red Hat, then jumped to Mandrake (before the fusion that produced Mandriva, which I never used), then to Ubuntu and back to Mandrake. Then Fedora. I also tried Mint and Manjaro and finally settled with Arch. Right now I use Arch in all my personal machines.

I also tried a bunch of desktop environments. Gnome 2, Gnome Shell, KDE and KDE Plasma, Cinnamon, Mate, Budgie, Xfce (which I used for a long time), you name it. I never felt completely at home in any of these. All of them feel bloated in a way and installed far too many packages by default that I never used or even knew about. 

This brings us to tiling window managers. I like the concept a lot and I think most developers should use one. They help make the most of the available space and organise windows in a logical and hassle-free way. Furthermore, you never really need to leave the keyboard if you don't want to, which is a big plus.
